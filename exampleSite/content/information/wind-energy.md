Wind energy is a key component of Germany's renewable energy strategy and plays an important role in our regional energy mix.

## Wind Energy in Our Region

The hills surrounding Musterstadt offer favorable conditions for wind energy generation. Currently, three wind farms within 30 km of our town produce enough electricity for approximately 25,000 households.

## How Wind Turbines Work

Modern wind turbines convert the kinetic energy of wind into electricity:

1. **Wind turns the blades** - The aerodynamic blades spin when wind flows over them
2. **Rotor drives generator** - The rotation is transferred to a generator via a gearbox
3. **Electricity is produced** - The generator converts mechanical energy to electrical energy
4. **Power reaches the grid** - Transformers adjust voltage for distribution

## Community Wind Projects

Community-owned wind projects allow citizens to invest in and benefit from wind energy:

- **Financial returns** - Shareholders receive dividends from electricity sales
- **Local benefits** - Revenue stays in the community
- **Democratic control** - Members have a voice in project decisions

Our initiative is exploring the possibility of a citizen wind park on the Mühlberg site. Contact us to learn more!

## Common Questions

### Are wind turbines noisy?

Modern turbines are remarkably quiet. At 500 meters distance, they're typically no louder than a refrigerator. German regulations require minimum distances from residential areas.

### What about birds?

Studies show that cats, buildings, and vehicles kill far more birds than wind turbines. Careful site selection and modern designs minimize wildlife impact.

### Do they work when there's no wind?

Turbines need minimum wind speeds of about 3-4 m/s to operate. In our region, this occurs approximately 80% of the time. When wind is insufficient, other energy sources fill the gap.
