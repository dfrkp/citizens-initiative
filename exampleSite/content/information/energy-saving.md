Before generating renewable energy, it makes sense to reduce the energy we need in the first place. Here are practical tips that can significantly lower your energy bills and carbon footprint.

## Heating and Cooling

Heating accounts for the largest share of household energy use in Germany.

- **Lower thermostat by 1°C** - Saves approximately 6% on heating costs
- **Use programmable thermostats** - No need to heat when nobody's home
- **Insulate properly** - Check windows, doors, and roof for drafts
- **Regular maintenance** - Annual boiler service improves efficiency

## Electricity

Simple changes can make a big difference:

### In the Kitchen
- Use lids when cooking (saves 25% energy)
- Match pot size to burner size
- Run dishwasher only when full
- Defrost freezer regularly

### Electronics
- Unplug chargers when not in use
- Use power strips to eliminate standby consumption
- Choose energy-efficient appliances (A+++ rating)
- Enable power-saving modes on computers

### Lighting
- Switch to LED bulbs (use 90% less energy than incandescent)
- Use natural light when possible
- Install motion sensors in hallways and bathrooms

## Water Heating

- Take showers instead of baths
- Fix dripping faucets promptly
- Wash clothes at 30°C when possible
- Consider a solar water heater

## Transportation

While not strictly household energy, transportation is a major source of emissions:

- Walk or cycle for short trips
- Use public transport
- Consider an e-bike for commuting
- Carpool when driving is necessary
- If buying a car, consider electric or hybrid

## Monitoring Your Usage

You can't improve what you don't measure:

1. **Check your meters regularly** - Track monthly consumption
2. **Smart meters** - Get real-time usage data
3. **Energy audit** - Our initiative offers free home assessments

## Financial Support

Several programs help fund energy-saving improvements:

- KfW renovation subsidies
- BAFA grants for heating system upgrades
- Regional energy efficiency programs
- Tax deductions for certain measures
